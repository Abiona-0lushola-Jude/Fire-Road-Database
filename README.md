# Fire-Road-Database
 Utilizing proximity analysis, road networks are assessed in relation to fire stations to optimize emergency response times. Markets are identified as high-risk areas susceptible to fire incidents due to factors like high foot traffic and flammable goods. Hospital data is integrated into the analysis to ensure emergency medical services are efficiently coordinated with firefighting efforts. Firefighter allocation tables are generated based on these analyses to strategically position resources for swift response and effective mitigation of fire incidents.
